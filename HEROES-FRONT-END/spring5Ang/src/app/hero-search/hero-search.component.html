<!--The *ngFor repeats hero objects. Notice that the *ngFor iterates over a list called heroes$, not heroes. The $ is a convention 
that indicates heroes$ is an Observable, not an array.-->

<!--Since *ngFor can't do anything with an Observable, use the pipe character (|) followed by async. This identifies Angular's AsyncPipe 
    and subscribes to an Observable automatically so you won't have to do so in the component class.-->
